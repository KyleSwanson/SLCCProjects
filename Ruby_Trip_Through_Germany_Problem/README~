Use the Gemfile (bundle). It will install everything for you. Kinda, you will need sqlite3 installed. On Ubuntu (most linux distros I imagine) install this -> libsqlite3-dev
Run the gemfile like "bundle install"

Oh, and use RVM and GEM for everything. It will make your life so much easier. 

I have no clue what Windows or Mac users should do.
