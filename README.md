============
A sample of some of the projects I worked on while at SLCC


## Câ™¯ Weather Application
This project implemented calls to a web service hosted by WeatherUnderground to fetch weather for a specified zip code to JSon. The application then parsed the results, and displayed them in a user friendly WPF gui.
