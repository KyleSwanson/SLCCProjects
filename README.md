A sample of a few of the projects I worked on while at SLCC


## Câ™¯ Weather Application
**Folder:** *[C_Sharp_Weather_App](https://github.com/KyleSwanson/SLCCProjects/tree/master/C_Sharp_Weather_App)*

This project implemented calls to a web service hosted by WeatherUnderground to fetch weather for a specified zip code to JSon. The application then parsed the results, and displayed them in a user friendly WPF gui.

## Ruby Trip Through Germany Problem
**Folder:** *[Ruby_Trip_Through_Germany_Problem](https://github.com/KyleSwanson/SLCCProjects/tree/master/Ruby_Trip_Through_Germany_Problem)*

For this assignment we were given a list of cities in Germany, then asked to find the most efficient way to travel between all the given cities. This assignment used a SQLite3 database to store information about places visited. I created a set of objects to make it easier for inserting and accessing cities in my database. It could be used like this: 
`basel = Place.create(:name=>"Basel", :expenses=>12000, :country=>"Switzerland")`
Using the information from the database the program tried to find the most optimal route based on time, money, and distance.

## Java Flip Book Application
**Folder:** *[Java_Flip_Book](https://github.com/KyleSwanson/SLCCProjects/tree/master/Java_Flip_Book)*

In this team project, we were assigned to make a Flip Book application. The user should be able to draw multiple slides using an array of drawing tools. Then playback the slides, and be able to export them to a video playable in most media players. Our application is able to do all of the above, including adjusting the playback speed, cloning slides, and many more features.
